# Oskarmovies
Similar to the Oscar rewards, this app also rates movies. Search engine where users can compare the IMDB rating vs the Rotten Tomatoes rating of movies by searching the movie title.

OBS - OMDB API DOES NOT PROVIDE ROTTENTOMATOES RATING ANYMORE :(

## Stack:
Front end: HTML, CSS, SemanticUI
Back end: OMDB API, NodeJS (Express.Js, Request, EJS), JSON

## How is it made:
- Connect OMDB API with Node.Js with request and parse JSON to JS object.
- styling, buttons, effects with SemanticUI
